# Kiva Data Visualization

This mini-repository is to host a github-pages site of the RMarkdown HTML for an analysis of Kiva data.

Check it out: [kevinrpan.com/kiva](http://kevinrpan.com/kiva)

Features:
- Hover-friendly plots
- Zoomable maps
- Useful variable breakdowns

Some of these tables and the analysis use functions from the [handy R package](https://github.com/KevinRPan/handy) - if you're interested in some data cleaning for yourself, please check that out also!
